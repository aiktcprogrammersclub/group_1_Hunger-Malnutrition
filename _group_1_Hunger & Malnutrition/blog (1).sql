And it&rsquo;s not just about my daughters. I know that our country needs every kid to grow up smart, healthy and strong.</p>\r\n<p>But there are so many parents out there who aren&rsquo;t as fortunate as I am, and so many children who come to school each day hungry and tired. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.hungerinourschools.org/">a new report out this week</a> from No Kid Hungry about kids facing hunger at school, and their research reveals a national crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Three out of every four educators they surveyed said their students regularly come to school hungry, and many of them say it happens at least once a week. When kids come to school with empty stomachs, they can''t concentrate, they lack energy, they disrupt class and -- of course -- their grades suffer.</p>\r\n<p>It''s a terrible problem, one so vast and so deeply connected to poverty and inequality that it seems insolvable.</p>\r\n<p>But it isn''t. There is a solution, and it&rsquo;s a simple one. Breakfast.</p>\r\n<p>Almost every child facing hunger attends a public school, where they get a healthy lunch, for free or at a reduced price, every day. The system, the staff and the infrastructure to feed daily meals to kids <em>is already in place</em>, in our neighborhood schools. Most importantly, federal funding exists to pay for not just lunches at school, but breakfast too.</p>\r\n<p>So why aren''t more kids eating breakfast at school? (And believe me, they''re not. Of the 16 million kids who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, less than half are also getting breakfast.)</p>\r\n<p>A couple reasons. For one thing, school breakfast is typically served before the bell rings, which means kids who need that meal have to be there early. That''s hard for any parent.</p>\r\n<p>Another reason, one that breaks my heart, is stigma. Everyone knows that the kids eating breakfast in the cafeteria in the morning are the poor kids, and no one wants to be seen as the poor kid.</p>\r\n<p>The thought of kids failing in school because they lacked such a simple thing &ndash; breakfast &ndash; makes me crazy.

That&rsquo;s two billion more than we attempt to feed today &ndash; with 805 chronically hungry and two billion suffering from micronutrient deficiencies. How then, will we be able to feed nine billion in the future if we continue using agricultural practices that are causing unprecedented damage to the environment and ourselves? If we don&rsquo;t make changes, we can&rsquo;t and we won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One major change that we can make: focusing on soil! The United Nations has declared 2015 to be the <a href="http://www.fao.org/soils-2015/en/" target="_self">International Year of Soils</a>. It&rsquo;s an opportune time to bring this forgotten, yet vitally important, resource to the forefront. If we&rsquo;re to create systems that produce healthy, nutritious food, it&rsquo;s going to have to start with changing how we look at soil today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Soil is a non-renewable, incredibly vital resource that is important to sustaining animals, plants, and humans. To be able to fulfill its many roles &ndash; including water filtration system, plant growth support, recycler of nutrients, pollutant filter, carbon storage, and buffer against floods, droughts, and climate change &ndash; it has to have the right mix of nutrients, diverse microorganisms that live within it to break down organic matter, and water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, due to unhealthy agricultural and land management practices, the nutrients in our soil are depleting at alarming rates. Monocropping, increased reliance on pesticides and fertilizers, and poor grazing practices are just a few of the unsustainable practices that are used today. These intensive agricultural practices are stripping nutrients from the soil every growing season and yielding crops with lower nutrient content.</p>\r\n<p>So what are some of the ingredients and techniques for a healthy agroecosystem to produce more nutritious foods while also improving the vitality of our soils?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cover crops:</strong> Plant cover crops (such as rye, clover, cowpeas, millet, or sorghum) to manage erosion, pests, and weeds, and replenish the nutrient and fertile content of soils.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Livestock:</strong> Get away from industrial agriculture and factory farms. Make livestock a part of the healthy farming ecosystem and install systems to appropriate deal with animal waste.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windbreaks</strong>: Plant borders of trees or shrubs to protect soil against erosion due to wind.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Organic fertilizer:</strong> Utilize crop waste and animal manure to naturally fertilize the soil and crops. If synthetic fertilizer is absolutely required, use it sparingly in a targeted microdosing rather than broad coverage.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wastewater: </strong>Given that 70% of water is used for agricultural purposes, it&rsquo;s important to find avenues to utilize wastewater for irrigation purposes and reduce overall water usage.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Irrigation: </strong>Use sustainable irrigation techniques and drought-resistant farming techniques.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Crop rotation: </strong>Rotating the planting of crops is important for fertilizing soil and reducing problems of pests and disease.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tillage:</strong> No-till farming helps protect soil by increasing the amount of organic matter and nutrients in the soil and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the air. Not tilling also increases the amount of water that can permeate the soil, reduce erosion, and make soils more resilient.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve come to a split in the road to feeding ourselves today and future generations. We can continue on our current path, one with unsustainable agricultural and land management practices. Or, we change course and take a healthier, more sustainable, and environmentally-friendly path. I vote for the latter.&nbsp;</p>', '2015-03-05 06:09:54'),

Since the 2008 World Food Summit, we have seen increasing global commitment to address food security and nutrition with the adoption of the <a title="Learn more about the Voluntary Guidelines " href="http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/" target="_blank">Voluntary Guidelines on the Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, Forests</a>, the recent adoption of the <a title="Learn more about the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems" href="http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-home/resaginv/en/" target="_blank">Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems</a>, and with the increasing commitments of governments to the Right to Food.</p>\r\n<p><strong>And yet 1 billion people are still living in extreme poverty and at least 2 billion suffer from malnutrition.</strong></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We are making progress but if we are truly serious about achieving zero hunger, we need to do better. Doing better means all hands on deck and all options on the table.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Achieving food and nutrition security touches almost every aspect of our lives and is impacted by decisions and events in almost every sector &ndash; from energy, to water, to climate change, to health, infrastructure, technology, transport, and so on. One of the main obstacles to progress has been our approach. We need to stop approaching food and nutrition security in silos and fully embrace the inter-linkages in order to facilitate the multi-dimensional actions required. Within the <a title="To CFS Website" href="http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-home/en/" target="_blank"><strong>Committee on World Food Security (CFS)</strong></a>, we have tackled a number of controversial topics which require multi-sectoral action from all stakeholders including climate change, land tenure, responsible investment, and food loss and waste, among others.</p>\r\n<div id="attachment_3313" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px;"><a href="http://blog.zerohungerchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/powa-conference-berlin-welthungerhilfe.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3313" src="http://blog.zerohungerchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/powa-conference-berlin-welthungerhilfe-300x196.jpg" alt="Dr. Gerd M&uuml;ller, B&auml;rbel Diekmann (left.) and Gerda Verburg (right.) at the conference &ldquo;Setting the Course for a World without Hunger&rdquo; in Berlin.

Addressing food security and nutrition has at times been a minefield of polarizing debates, when in fact the best solutions are often found when we can combine and build on ideas and options from across the spectrum.</p>\r\n<p>The<a title="Find out: G7 summit in Germany" href="http://www.g7germany.de/Webs/G7/EN/Home_en/home_node.html" target="_blank"><strong> upcoming G7 summit in Berlin </strong></a>in June this year presents another opportunity for us to reflect on how we &ndash; rich countries, poorer countries, private sector, civil society, farmers &ndash; all need to look at our individual strengths in order to work together to collectively end hunger. There can be a tendency to approach food security and nutrition through a &lsquo;victim&rsquo; or &lsquo;aid&rsquo; approach, when actually we have seen that empowering farmers and communities to provide for themselves and their families is what presents lasting benefits.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The G7 can better focus on empowering smallholders by first making sure that they are listening to what smallholders are saying&nbsp;<em>themselves</em> about their needs and what will provide the enabling environment for them to achieve food security and nutrition for their families and produce for markets worldwide.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I am continuously reminded by the smallholders&rsquo; and family farmers that participate in the&nbsp;<a title="Get in Touch: CFS on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Committee-on-World-Food-Security-CFS/391822297628266?fref=nf" target="_blank"><strong>Committee on World Food Security</strong></a> that while they are &lsquo;small&rsquo; they are also strong and many.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Smallholders account for more than 95 percent of agricultural holdings and feed up to 80 percent of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.</li>\r\n<li>They continue to be the largest investors in their own farming as they seek to increase productivity, improve their own well-being, and provide nutritious food for their families and communities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>However, they need us to act in concert with them, and that shouldn&rsquo;t mean necessarily seeking to attach them to global value chains, but to explore their leadership role in addressing food security and nutrition in their own communities and national context. This means not just focusing on increasing productivity but assessing needs both on farm and off farm, and making sure that smallholders are part of the conversations to determine how to achieve zero hunger.</p>', '2015-03-05 06:13:50'),

I was therefore delighted that we recently <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/i4pzasmqpbeh642qv6yq" target="_blank">hosted a meeting</a> that is probably more unusual than it should be: a collection of experts in nutrition and the field of Integrated Community Case Management (ICCM) &mdash; who lead the drive to combat pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea &mdash; who met to address the pressing challenge of how to reach the <a href="http://www.ennonline.net/ourwork/reviews/donorfinancing" target="_blank">90 percent of malnourished children</a> who&nbsp;are not receiving the simple but vital support they need.</p>\r\n<p>The interest for the IRC is obvious: with half of the world''s extreme poor living in conflict zones or fragile states, a significant proportion of the population we most care about are children, and we know from our experience that many of them suffer from malnourishment. The global figures are horrendous. Malnutrition is an underlying cause of 45 percent of all deaths of children under five. Around 165 million children are malnourished, and 20 million of those children suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a condition that makes them up to nine times more likely to die than a healthy child.</p>\r\n<p>It is troubling that in the proposed revised Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), nutrition takes a back seat.&nbsp;While reducing child mortality is listed as one of the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/mdgoverview/mdg_goals/mdg4" target="_blank">eight goals for 2015</a>,&nbsp;neither the efforts to, or the need to, address malnutrition is mentioned.&nbsp;This fails to address a global need. This is particularly regrettable, given that effective tools exist to&nbsp;both prevent and treat malnutrition.</p>\r\n<p>I opened the meeting by talking about the need to move from a view of "hard-to-reach people" to one that tackled the problem of "hard-to-reach services." This is a question of outlook as much as policy. A deficit model of the victims never helps. It points to the need to build on the success of ICCM in taking services to people, rather than relying on people to reach services. Our experience in places like South Sudan shows the value of this. By placing community healthworkers in even the smallest, most remote villages, the IRC helped increase ten-fold the number of children accessing treatment during illness.<br /> <br />The IRC has a range of activities underway looking at the position of under-nourished children in conflict situations and fragile states. In 2014, the IRC treated more than 100,000 children under the age of five for acute malnutrition. We supported nutrition programming in 15 countries, which include countries in the midst of active conflict, such as Mali, South Sudan and Yemen.<br /> <br /> In order to reach more malnourished children in South Sudan, the IRC is piloting the first effort, to our knowledge, to train illiterate community healthworkers to treat children&nbsp;directly&nbsp;for malnutrition.&nbsp;We can do this because we have seen these workers provide <a href="http://www.ajtmh.org/content/87/5_Suppl/144.long" target="_blank">effective, high-quality treatment</a> for other diseases, such as malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia. We know that the workers'' lack of education is not a barrier to their service: they understand and apply protocols. In fact, they often do so in more appropriate, culturally sensitive ways than more educated workers in health facilities.</p>\r\n<p>This is just one of several nutrition innovations that the IRC is pursuing to reach more children in need. For example,&nbsp;we are also, in collaboration with academic partners, <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/ovubt6havmd6j3p4p1g5" target="_blank">evaluating a combined protocol</a> that improves continuity of care for both moderately and severely malnourished children.<br /> <br /> The MDGs focused attention on a handful of deadly childhood diseases, saving millions of lives in the process. As we develop their successors, the Sustainable Development Goals, we have a chance to save another group: the millions of children, many of them in conflict states, who suffer from malnutrition, and are currently not getting the life-saving treatment they need. Our experience has shown us it''s possible. It''s time to act.</p>\r\n<p><em>David Miliband is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.
